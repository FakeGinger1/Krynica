            Krynicas' altitude of 560 to 720 meters, earned the town fame for
            its medicinal waters (fitting as “Zdrój” means mineral spring in
            Polish). The town's springs offer a variety of alkaline and acidic
            waters with high levels of trace elements and very distinct tastes
            and numerous health benefits. The first water analysis took place in
            1788-1795 and in
            <time datetime="2015-05-29">1807</time> Krynica-Zdrój officially
            became a spa and to this days has many sanatoriums, mineral/mud
            baths and a water pump house

          <p class="main-text">
            The town's reputation as a winter sports oasis can be attributed to
            its incredible mountain location with one of its ski resorts on
            Jaworzyna Kryniczka reaching a peak of 1,114 meters. The terrain
            surrounding Krynica-Zdrój allows for practicing both Alpine and
            classic skiing. Winter sports tournaments have been hosted in the
            town since the interwar period, more recently the Winter World
            Polonia Games were hosted in
            <time datetime="2015-05-29">2018</time> and

              Krynica is also dotted with brilliantly colourful,
              nineteenth-century wooden villas and houses. These were built
              after the town's increase in spa and sanatorium patients in the
              mid 1800s. The design of these villas' was inspired by the Swiss
              style of architecture at the time. Many of these buildings have
              been preserved allowing tourists to witness the beautifully
              intricate carvings and mouldings.

              Krynica is also home to famous naïve painter, Nikifor Krynicki
              (1895-1968), who painted upwards of 40,000 paintings on various
              surfaces ranging from cigarette cartons to sheets of paper. His
              paintings, most depicting the cityscape of Krynica-Zdrój, took
              inspiration from the architecture of orthodox churches and villas.
              In
              <time datetime="2015-05-29">1995</time>, the town opened a museum
              in the painter's memory and later, in
              <time datetime="2005">29 May 2015</time> erected a statue of
              Nikifor which sits in a square looking out onto a small street
              named after him.
