    <h4>Recommended Spots!</h4>
    <h5>Góra Parkowa</h5>
    <p>
      Krynica-Zdrój sits right at the base of the Parkowa mountain (Góra
      Parkowa) which reaches an altitude of 741 metres. By ascending the
      mountain via a series of wooden sloped pathways to view the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Charmingly built mineral water pump rooms</li>
      <li>Nineteenth-century wooden gazebos</li>
      <li>
        Many statues, among them the forest shrine of Our Lady Queen of
        Krynica-Zdrój.
      </li>
      <li>
        Countless ponds including a swan pond surrounded by ancient trees.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You can also get to the peak by riding the funicular train (built in 1937)
      to more quickly see the tourist attractions at the top. During the winter
      it is used for skiing, snowboarding and sledding, with beautiful immersive
      light displays at night. In the summer exhibitions are put up showing the
      history of the town and you can better enjoy the surrounding Zdrojowy park
    </p>

    <h5>Tree-top Tower</h5>

    <p>
      Walk this 1030m pathway among the tall pine tree forest of Slotwiny. This
      wooden lookout tower reaches 49.5 metres high which equals to 15 stories
      tall! The wooden path is decorated by information boards providing context
      about the surrounding wildlife, nature and history. Finish this
      spectacular walk off with a quick descent on a 60 metre slide, not just
      for kids! During the summer concerts are held below the tower, pairing
      music with an exceptional view. In the winter take the short walk to the
      neighbouring ski resort to make the most of the winter snowfall.
