Design Choices:

I wanted this website to look modern but still reflect the charm of Krynica-Zdrój.
I chose a green color scheme and a darker color for the body to represent the greenery 
and nature seen around the town. Ultimately I also decided to have a contrasting cool red as 
the background color for the main text titles. Both the color of the background and the text 
highlight the colors in the hero banners on every page. I chose to divide the layout of each 
page into different ratios of responsive columns to make the page look more dynamic on larger 
screens while maintaining readability on smaller screens. I chose to make the navbar at the 
top of the screen collapsible so as to not make the top of the screen too busy on smaller 
screens. I implemented large carousel images on history.html to utilize the space on the 
page while not overcrowding it with images and again making it more dynamic to the eye. 
I was originally going to use a collapse element in the right column of the visit.html 
page however I did not like how the entire page moved when opening each tab. I instead 
opted to use a nav element as it more seamlessly fit into the page and allowed me to add 
multiple images without taking much more page space. Images were sourced from Wikimedia 
commons except the hero banners of the history.html and visit.html pages which are my own.

Challenges:

During the design process I faced a few challenges. One was deciding which layout system 
to use in order to get my elements in place. Ultimately I decided on the Bootstrap 5 grid 
system as I was planning on implementing multiple Bootstrap 5 elements in the web design. 
Deciding on how many images to use was also a struggle as I did not want too many as to not 
make the pages feel more like Power-Point slides rather than website pages. However, implementing 
the Bootstrap 5 image carousel allowed me to include all the images I wanted to showcase without
overcrowding the layout. Making the layout fully responsive for each device was also challenging.
However, by using http://www.responsinator.com/ let me better visualize how each change I made
affected the pages responsiveness. In the end, I decided to only use “em” or “%” for size 
specifications in CSS. Lastly, keeping my code clean and streamlined was also a challenge
as I had to keep revising the code and making changes throughout the process. Making sure
 to go over the code on each page as a whole and validating the pages often for CSS and HTML
  allowed me to maintain a fairly organized code throughout.
